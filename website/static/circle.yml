# CircleCI by default tests every push to every branch. This mean automated release from source to gp-pages will trigger CI testing gp-pages.
# we disable that. Piece and quiet: https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/configuration/#branches
# this also prevents pull requests from triggering the CI and thrashing e.g. the crowdin translation logic in our main circle.yml
# gp-pages is cleared out on every push, so we can't manually put a circle.yml there. So we piggy back off static/ being copied over to gp-pages during deployment.
general:
  branches:
    ignore:
      - gh-pages
